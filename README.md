# canphone
Raspberry-pi based tin can phone, using Windows IoT

# Goal
Create 2x tin cans, each having a cat5 cord dangling out the bottom.
Plug them each into a live ethernet port, and you can talk from one & hear the output on the other.

# Why?
Fun project for me to play around with Raspberry Pi and Windows 10 IoT

# Status?
Just started.
